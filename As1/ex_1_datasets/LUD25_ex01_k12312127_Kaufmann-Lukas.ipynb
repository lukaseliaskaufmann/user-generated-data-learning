    "\n",
    "## Recommendation Scenario\n",
    "Imagine a platform where users consume items: buy goods (Amazon), listen to music tracks (Deezer, Spotify), watch movies (Netflix) or videos (YouTube).\n",
    "\n",
    "At some point a user may face a choice: \"what item should I have a look at next?\" Can be that they don't know what exactly they need and are unable to formulate a query. Of course with catalogs of millions of items they have little chance finding something useful by browsing through all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such situations Recommender Systems are expected to make the decision easier for the user by shrinking the scope to a handful of individually selected options, for example top 10 recommended songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information the recommendation can be based on:\n",
    "* Items already consumed by the user\n",
    "* Items consumed by other users\n",
    "* User relations\n",
    "* Item meta-data & content\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "\n",
    "User-Item interactions is one of the most widely used signals in recommendation. Initially it can be available in a form of system logs (see table below). There is a multitude of ways a user can interact with an item: consume (buy, watch, listen), note (like, save to favorites), share and others. In this exercise we only deal with item consumption.\n",

    "## Datasets\n",
    "Throughout the whole exercise track we will be mostly working on music & movie recommendation tasks. Note that all methods we consider are applicable to other domains!\n",
    "\n",
    "[LFM-2b](http://www.cp.jku.at/datasets/LFM-2b/) is a large dataset of over two billion listening events, spanning across ~15 years, crawled from LastFM platform. It is supported with user demographics information and music track meta-data. In this exercise we take a look at a small sample of the aggregated LFM-2B (lfm-tiny) as well as MovieLens-1M dataset (ml-1m). Each of them consists of three files, in case of lfm-tiny it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 'lfm-tiny.inter' - data about user-track interactions;\n",
    "* 'lfm-tiny.item' - track-related information;\n",
    "* 'lfm-tiny.user' - user-related information;\n",
    "    \n",
    "And for ml-1m respectively:\n",
    "    \n",
    "* 'ml-1m.inter' - data about user-movie ratings;\n",
    "* 'ml-1m.item' - movie-related information;\n",
    "* 'ml-1m.user' - user-related information;\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important note:\n",
    "**'lfm-tiny.inter'** contains cumulative number of listening events per pair User-Track over the whole period;\n",
    "    \n",
    "**'ml-1m.inter'** contains **ratings** per pair User-Track on a scale from 1 to 5;\n",
    "\n",
    "**The interpretation of the interaction feedback (listening events or ratings) is usually up to the designer of a recommender system. In this course we treat any feedback as IMPLICIT FEEDBACK**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implicit feedback\n",
    "The MovieLens dataset provides us with ratings users give to movies, this allows us to judge if a user (dis)likes one movie more than the other.\n",
    "    \n",
    "However, we do not always have explicit information about whether a user likes or dislikes a certain item (and to which extent). In case of LFM-2B we only know how many times a user have interacted with a certain item. The fact of a single interaction with a track does not mean that the user enjoyed it, so how many interactions do we need to be sure?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Following the concept of **Implicit Feedback** we binarise our interaction data: to every pair **User** and **Item** we assign 1 - user sufficiently (enough times or gave a sufficiently high rating) interacted with the item **or** 0 - user did not interact with the item / did not enjoy it / unknown.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Very roughly speaking recommendation with implicit feedback is a binary classification problem: prediction of whether the user is going to interact with an item or not.\n",

    "Interaction matrix is a common data structure used in some (not all) recommender algorithms. It is a matrix with dimensions: [number of users] times [number of items] known to the system.

It receives three dataframes, dataset name and an int threshold value as input and returns a 2-dimensional numpy array with the corresponding interaction matrix, where **0** means the user didn't interact with the track on purpose or didn't like it (played the track \\< [threshold] times, or gave a rating \\< [threshold] in the case of ml-1m), **1** means the user listened to the track more than or equal to [threshold] times (or gave a rating that is higher or equal to [threshold] in the case of ml-1m).\n",
